If Statment Notes:

"If" statements allow you to tell the program that if something meets a certain requirment as dictated by you than it must do that thing that you stated.

You also can put an "else" statment, that corsponds to your "if" statement and dictates if the requirments of the "if" statement are not met than do the "else statement.

For example:

If: coffee is to hot than don't drink the coffee.

Else: Unless the coffee is too cold than also don't drink.
