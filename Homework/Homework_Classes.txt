Classes are the factories where boxes and machines work in for example.
The class is a cotainer for all of your variables and fuctions and are used for object oranted programing.
Classes should be dedticated to one task. You do it this way so that it easy for you keep track of what your script is doing.
It is much more managable to always keep it clean in coding.
